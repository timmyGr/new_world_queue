# New World Queue Queue

## Why?

Sooooo... I sat in queue for a bit, finally got logged in, 
but was busy around the house. Jeff Bezos decided to kick me from the game and force me back
into a 4 hour line.

## What?

This little script, using OCR, will detect my position in queue. Next steps are to have 
it alert me directly on my phone with SMS. That will probably be done tomorrow while I'm waiting another 4 hours.

## Huh?

Maybe you can give it a go and take your life back from New World's queue.

Only thing you really need installed is python 3.9 and Tesseract (my first time using OCR yeah!).
